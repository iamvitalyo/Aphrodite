# this iis draft and code maybe dont works.

# the rule if pentagram from sticks in logic we can use only 2, 1 stick and dot
# also if pentagram we must use logic of shapes what <=5
# first his data will be 5050 symbols all symbols of circle, for that we will use numbers with mark "o" for exxample "o1".."o5050"
# second his data will be our dictionary and alphabet
# we should just run star she must generate and record data
# also we will do logic code where if last his data with "eval(" function and will write to him that he can run any using this logic
# he must by circle watch on self data and generate new and replace old, if eval in data we run. 
# 1 love|materia|dot, 2 stick|life|plus, 3 tringel|truh, 4 square|death, 5 pentagon|nolove
# the idea that he can works only on 5050 symbols, this inner circle - base of him, our alphabet and dictionary its out of circle but 5 must also understood 
# pentagram must be logical text generator and fulltext search by logic
# maybe stick to the up *||+ to the down /||-, triangel start from head balance will be stick up => stick down => stick up
#
# lets play but i think many at up is miistake we must draw becouse art balance of accurate between is geometry
# left hand give right get so by clock its get reverse give
# 2 minds must work sync one by clock another reverse, get and set.
